                    <span>He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. I know, and all I could
                        say is I'm sorry. Lorraine. Hey, don't I know you from somewhere? Mr. McFly, Mr. McFly, this
                        just arrived, oh hi Marty. I think it's your new book.

                        Looks like a airplane, without wings. Yeah, but I never picked a fight in my entire life. I
                        still don't understand, how am I supposed to go to the dance with her, if she's already going to
                        the dance with you. What were you doing in the middle of the street, a kid your age. Bet your
                        ass it works.

                        you guys look great. Mom, you look so thin. Yeah well look, Marvin, Marvin, you gotta play. See
                        that's where they kiss for the first time on the dance floor. And if there's no music, they
                        can't dance, and if they can't dance, they can't kiss, and if they can't kiss, they can't fall
                        in love and I'm history. Hey you, get your damn hands off, oh. No, why, what's a matter? Now
                        remember, according to my theory you interfered with with your parent's first meeting. They
                        don't meet, they don't fall in love, they won't get married and they wont have kids. That's why
                        your older brother's disappeared from that photograph. Your sister will follow and unless you
                        repair the damages, you will be next.

                        I'll find out through the natural course of time.

                        Yes, definitely, god-dammit George, swear. Okay, so now, you come up, you punch me in the
                        stomach, I'm out for the count, right? And you and Lorraine live happily ever after. Ah, honey,
